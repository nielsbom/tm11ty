        Tatiana Mac (they/she) is an independent Viá»‡t-American software engineer and
        open source maintainer and creator of
        <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.selfdefined.app"
          >Self-Defined</a
        >. Tatiana writes, edits, and speaks on building for the web, design
        systems, and engineering culture.

      <h2 class="t-white t-serifweight heading">People over profits ethos</h2>
      <p class="t-blush-pink">
        As tech workers, Tatiana believes we have a responsibility to protect
        people over profits. The trifecta of accessibility, performance, and
        security can work symbiotically to improve our social landscape
        digitally and physically. When ethically-minded, Tatiana thinks
        technologists can dismantle exclusionary systems in favour of
        community-focused, inclusive ones.
      </p>

      <h2 class="t-white t-serifweight heading">Will speak for travel</h2>
      <p class="t-blush-pink">
        An international keynote speaker and TEDx alumnus, Tatiana speaks on the
        intersection of technology and ethics, examining how our products both
        fit into and define our social and environmental settings. Tatiana has given over 30 talks in over a dozen countries across 5 continents. View

      <h2 class="t-white t-serifweight heading">Past careers: Editor; art, creative director</h2>
      <p class="t-blush-pink">
        A once-aspiring foreign correspondent and trained journalist, Tatiana is
        a former editor at
        <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://www.alistapart.com/"
          >A List Apart</a
        >, volunteered for the <em>The Atlantic's</em>
        <a class="t-link-accent-pink" href="https://covidtracking.com/"
          >Covid Tracking Project</a
        >, and has edited numerous technical journals and books, most recently
        <a

          href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-c/9781491976692/"
          >O'Reilly's Head First C#</a
        >. Before engineering, Tatiana built an extensive career as an art and creative director for clients like Nike and Taco Bell.

    <h2 class="t-white t-serifweight heading">Beyond drone life</h2>
      <p class="t-blush-pink">
        A systems thinker, Tatiana's love extends beyond computer language to human languages. Specifically, Tatiana is fascinated by language structures and discovering unexpected patterns, like when seemingly disconnected languages share the same word because of antiquated trade routes. A full-stack linguist, Tatiana can say a few words in many languages, express much in far fewer, and otherwise is not embarassed to try. Tatiana would rather look like a fool if it means being in connection with someone.
      </p>
      <p class="t-blush-pink">
        With a
        (land) body-count of 36, Tatiana frequents National, Dulles, and Baltimore airports to return home to Washington,
        DC.
